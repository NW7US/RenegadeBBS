 harm your user database and always make backups. If you choose not
 to read this and run this program and some how it fucks up your
 User Data Base don't come crying to me. I warned you and wavie all
 rights to be sued.

  With that said.  This is a generic User Packer/Purger for the
  Renegade BBS y2ka2 / 11-26.3 / 12-30.3, Yes the latest release!!,
  source code. Used with Turbo(Borland) Pascal or Vitrual Pascal.
  If your going to use this with Vitrual Pascal you will have to
  modify the Records.pas, because I tried to compile it and it
  crap'd on some of the names in the records.pas . (change .as to .a1s
  and it should work)

  Well, to explain how it works. First it takes the users.idx and
  sorts out that- to have only the names that are not deleted with
  empty records that were deleted in there place. Then it takes
  that and makes a New users.dat. of course over writting the
  blank records in the idx. Then it takes that New users.dat file
  and makes a New Idx file without the blanks in it.  It's
  confussing why, but try to figure out why the .idx file was set up
  to keep the old records and just point the new ones that were added
  to the new record number is beyond me, but Shrug.. I did a work
  around.  Well, it's better for indexing.  So, if a new user
  joins the board all they have to do is fill that slot and point
  the users.dat to that record. or via versa.

  This is under the gnu copywrite. As where you can use it in any
  program or way you would like, but remains copyright in my name.
  Or just meantion my name in the doc files.. ie pre-code written
  by: chris hoppman. ;)

  Last thing. 

  Welp, have fun. L8rz
